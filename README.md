<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

<!-- Features -->
### :dart: General Structure

We use the TAIPEI_diabetes dataset to train ML models within a pipeline (Jupyter Notebook). 
The best model is selected and saved, then integrated within a Streamlit-hosted application to infer diabetes predictions based on user input.

### :robot: ML Pipeline 

#### Data Preprocessing

The dataset was first loaded and then thoroughly cleaned. 
The dataset has 15,000 entries, 9 initial features (PatientID, Pregnancies, PlasmaGlucose, DiastolicBloodPressure,	TricepsThickness,	SerumInsulin,	BMI, DiabetesPedigree,	Age) for each patient corresponding to real gathered medical data, and 1 Diabetic categorical variable (1 = Diabetic/ 0 = Non-Diabetic).

The cleaning steps included:

- Check for NaN presence (Not A Number values)
- Removal of duplicates
- Removal of PatientID column which brings no valuable information

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A comprehensive EDA was performed, with steps including:

- Checking for missing data to identify abnormal null values (for DiastolicBloodPressure for instance, which cannot be 0)
- Distribution analysis of features (histograms, Kernel Density Estimation, boxplots) and categorical variable
- Removal of outliers based on actual medical values when it as judged necessary
- Plotting a first correlation matrix to investigate relations between features and target variable 

Examination of the average scores by essay set, highlighting the variation in grading across different topics.

#### Feature Engineering

To enrich the model's input data, several feature engineering steps were conducted:

- Binning of numerical features into 5 new categorical data features to more precise insights (Age, BMI, Glucose, BloodPressure, Pregnancies)
- Creation of 3 new indexes (Pseudo Matsuda Index, BMI_DiabetesPedigree, DBP_Age_Freq_Score)
- Visualization of the new features impact (mutual_info, Correlation Matrix) with a first manual removal of the less significative features
- Applying a Yeo-Johnson transformation and standardization of the remaining features to equalize scales and skewness

#### Model Training and Selection

For the modeling, training and testing phase:

- 5 models were investigated (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost) and trained using a 3-fold Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation and GridSearch for hyperparameters optimization
- Test results according to the ROC-AUC score metric and classification report data (confusion matrix, F1-score, recall, accuracy, precision) are printed for each model-
- The best model (XGBoost) according to our principal metric is then saved (with pickle module) for future use in the Streamlit application

### ðŸ’» Streamlit Application

The Diabetes Prediction app proposes 4 pages to explore : 
- Prediction
- Study Report
- Model Evaluation
- About

#### Prediction

Allows the user to conduct a diabetes diagnosis prediction based on its inputs for the different concerned features (Age, BMI, etc.), for a single (Single Prediction button) or multiple (Multiple Prediction) individuals (by charging a CSV file), and debuging insights.

#### Study Report

Provides several key visual insights about the dataset used and its features (features histograms, class repartition - Diabetic VS Non-Diabetic, correlation matrix between features and target variable).

#### Model Evaluation

Provides statistics from the classification report of the selected model (XGBoost) used for prediction (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, features importances for this model, both basic and crafted during features engineering step before the model training

#### About

Provides general informations about diabetes, recap info concerning the dataset, and contributors info.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## 	:toolbox: Getting Started

<!-- Running the project online -->
### :technologist: Running the project online

Use the Streamlit badge at the beginning of the file to make automatic diabetes diagnosis predictions.

<!-- Running the project locally -->
### :exclamation: Prerequisites - Running the project locally

Clone the project
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NathanBrunet/ML-Project-Diabetes-Prediction.git
```
Install all necessary requirements

```bash
  pip install -r requirements_full.txt
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd projects/ML_Project_Diabetes_Prediction
```

Run the ML pipeline to see how it works and save automatically the best ML model from its training on the initial TAIPEI_diabetes.csv file
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```

Run the Streamlit app which automatically retrieves the saved ML model to make diagnosis predictions locally and benefit from dataset insights and information
```bash
  streamlit run st_app.py
```

A small script is finally furnished to gather insights about the model used in the application. Run this command to obtain them
```bash
  python model_inspection.py
```
